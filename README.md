**How To Use:**

If you aren't using a realtek driver you will have to install VB Audio Cable. Sound has to be ran through VB Audio Cable or Stereo Mix. They will have to be set as default devices.

Multiple Audio sources will confuse the bot so turn down game music and turn off sounds for everything except albion.

The Bot will attempt a catch when the audio threshold goes over. This is an adjustable value.

You may have to adjust the area where the bot scans for the minigame. This is simple to do.

Use 'Select Tracking Zone' to select the approximate area show in this image
